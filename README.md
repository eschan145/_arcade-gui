# arcade-gui
A GUI extension for the Python arcade library

This project is still in progress. Currently, a `Combobox` widget is being developed.

To install, change the `arcade.Text`'s label to an HTML label. This will give you the features of HTML text. If you don't do this, you will not be able to use HTML text in Labels.

For an example, run the `__init__.py` file and see the example.
