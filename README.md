# arcade-gui
A GUI extension for the Python arcade library

This project is still in progress. Currently, a `Combobox` widget is being developed.

To install, change the `arcade.Text`'s label to an HTML label. This will give you the features of HTML text. If you don't do this, you will not be able to use HTML text in Labels.
